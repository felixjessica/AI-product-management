## Overview  <a name="overview"/>

In this final project (Capstone) of the NanoDegree, we will develop a business proposal for an AI product of our choosing.

We have selected a project about COVID-19 pneumonia detection since we have already made some projects about pneumonia detection in the previous assignments and we can use the gained experience in the final project.

In our business proposal, we will cover some important aspects of product development which will be described below.

## The Business Goal    <a name="goal"/>

Our first step in writing the business proposal is describing our product and explaining how it will provide value to the business.

We need to express what the product will do in detail and set out why and how this helps the business. It is crucial that we link the AI/ML task to business goals such as increasing revenue or customer happiness.

## Success Metrics  <a name="metrics"/>

Along with the business goal we also need to define success metrics to evaluate the product if it is successful or not.

Measurable, predictive, comparable, and benchmarked metrics such as 

- Customer Experience,
- Revenue gain,
- Customer engagement,
- Business process automation,
- Better and faster decision making,

are crucial for business success.

## Data    <a name="data"/>

We also need to think about the training data. Some questions to ask ourselves maybe

- Shall we buy or collect the data?
- Where and how to collect the data? 
- Are there any PII (Personally-Identifying Information) issues?
- Are there data sensitivity issues?
- What is the cost of collecting the data?
- Is there any bias in the data?

## Model   <a name="model"/>

Thinking about the model is another aspect of the business proposal. While training the model algorithm we may consider using an in-house team or outsource the training. We also need to think about using the cloud or not. While thinking about using the cloud we need to consider data security issues, compute power, cost, etc.

## Minimum Viable Product <a name="mvp"/>

We shall think about our product and decide and describe the user. We need to describe how the product looks like and how the user uses our product (through a WEB page, a mobile app, a program that is installed on a PC, etc.). 

## Post-MVP-Deployment <a name="deploy"/>

Finally, we shall plan what happens after launch. 

- How do we ensure the product continues to perform well?
- Who will monitor the product?
- How will they monitor the product, and how often?

## Project Structure <a name="structure"/>

- *Create_an_AI_Product_Project_Files* directory is the root directory. 
- *images* folder is for example images, 
- *capstone-project-proposal.docx* is the business proposal document filled by me.
- *capstone-project-proposal.pdf* is the pdf version of the final business proposal document.
